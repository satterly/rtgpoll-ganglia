Uses (and useless without) the excellent work of many others, including:
 MySQL, UCD/Net-SNMP, gd, png, cgilib and SNMP_Session.

Inspired by the likes of MRTG, RRDtool (Tobias Oetiker, Dave Rand)
and Cricket (Jeff Allen).

Special thanks to RTG co-maintainer Chris Brotsos.

Thanks to all those who have tested and provided patches or suggestions
to RTG!
