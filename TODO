Please help support the RTG community.  The following items need work and
are roughly in order of importance.  Some tasks are already in progress;
please contact the owner first if you'd like to help.  Thanks!

1. Auto-size plot border to fit legend.

4. Add proper timezone support.

5. Add "pacing" to poller to specify a minimum inter-query rate
to a single device.

6. Allow rtgplot to aggregate arbitrary device:interface pairs.

7. Allow rtgplot to aggregate a dynamic number of interface (currently
works for maximum of five interfaces).

8. Add "halos" to rtgplot indicating poll status.

9. Modify database schema to track interface changes (description change,
removal, etc) over time.  Modify rtgtargmkr.pl to use this schema.

10. Add in buffering mechanism to buffer poll results in case the SQL 
database is down or unreachable.

11. Develop functionality for multiple rtgpoll clients to talk to one
another to provide distributed polling or some form of redundancy.

12. Need to add more graceful recovery from failed/restarted pollers.
Currently a poller that is restarted will look like a drop in 
traffic for the period of time the poller was down.


12. Add SNMPv3 support.
